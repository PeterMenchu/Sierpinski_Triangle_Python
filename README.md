# Sierpinski_Triangle_Python
Python code to create a fractal triangle pattern. Code will calculate and plot the results with matplotlib. Recommended use is to load with Pycharm, but you can run this code in jupyter 
notebooks, google Colab, or the command line. If using Pycharm or the command line, make sure
you imported numpy and matplotlib. 

Check the image file for an example of the results.
